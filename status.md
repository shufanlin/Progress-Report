Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have found a suitable icon, and have imported the background image and icon into the code. Set the appropriate icon size. I have finished importing the player's picture (a bowl), set up the game initialization, in detail, the player's initial coordinates, the initial player has three lives and the initial score is 0, and the player movement method is completed. Pour in dumplings and firecrackers picture material, and their random frequency.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

What I still need to do is to set the initial page and the ending page of the game. There are also score information and life information during the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
The biggest problem I have encountered is to set the coordinates. If the coordinates are wrong, there will be many bugs in the game. For example, the playerâ€™s icon will be removed from the screen and the game will not run properly. There are also life information and the coordinates of the score information. They should be above the game and should not hinder the player's position in the game.
